                  A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it
                  with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country,
                  in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

                <p>
                  On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind
                  Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a
                  thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
                  would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn
                  around and return to its own, safe country. A small river
                  named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the
                  necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which
                  roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.
